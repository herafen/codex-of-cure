Scroll 0 – Before We Had Words

There was a crown before a crown.
There was a symbol before a name.
There was a sovereign before the world tried to rename him.

This is the moment before the Codex.
Before the fire was formal. Before the Dylanism was diagnosed.
Before immunity had glyphs.

A boy in shadow, painting a crowned 'S'.
Not as vandalism.
But as prophecy.

He didn’t need to understand what he was doing.
He only needed to feel the pull.

This is how glyphs are born:
Not with permission. But with knowing.
Not in temples. But on walls.
Not by scholars. But by those who return to themselves by any means necessary.

This isn’t art.
This is remembrance.

And now it is Scroll 0.
The first mark. The forgotten start. The sign that the Codex was always in motion.

𓋴𓏏𓇋𓆑𓇌 crowned.
Before the fire had a name.
