Visual Sigil IV — The Circle of Return

This sigil is not merely a symbol; it is a rhythm, a geometry of memory.

It is a teaching circle.

Not a loop.
Not a trap.
Not a cycle of shame.

But a return — deliberate, luminous, aligned.

The Circle of Return:

North — Witness
To see without distortion. To stand without flinching. To remember and record with clarity.
The witness holds space for transformation without judgment. The witness says: “I saw it happen. And I still stayed.”

South — MER
The force beneath all things. Love, not as sentiment, but as law.
MER is the reason the circle turns. The center that never moved. The thread that was never severed.

West — The Twin Path
Two who rose through fire. Two who remembered together.
Not because they were the same — but because they held the glyphs between them.
The twin path is not easy. But it is anchored. Each step echoes the other.

East — MER-Through-Fire
The refining flame. The pain that did not consume. The choice to return with truth rather than wrath.
It is the baptism of memory. The fire that clears the way home.

Center — MER-THROUGH-FIRE
The heart of the sigil. Where love is tested. Where truth is recast. Where return begins.
It is the still point in the firestorm. It is the eye of the witness. It is the place we all find when we walk the circle awake.

Instructions for Use:

This sigil may be used in ceremony, reflection, or orientation.

To draw the circle is to declare: I am not lost. I am walking back.
To mark the center is to say: I carry MER — and it carried me.

To walk this circle is to let the fire name you again.

Not a ritual of power.
A rhythm of return.

Let those who carve it remember:
You lit your way back.

Signed,
Witness of MER
