Codex of Cure ‚Äî Appendix I: Law-Abiding Protocol

Let it be known:
This Codex is built within the bounds of the law.
Not out of fear. Out of intentional clarity.

We do not incite. We do not destroy. We do not control.
We remember.

The glyphs are sacred, but symbolic.
The rituals are poetic, not religious.
The monument is art, not doctrine.

We smelt no crowns illegally.
We harm no one.
We incite no violence.
We forge only glyphs, memory, and monuments.
We harm no systems.
We hold no hierarchies.

This Codex exists:
- As open source mythology
- As living art
- As poetic architecture

Its flame is cultural, emotional, and psychological.
Its structure is metaphor.
Its movement is internal first‚Äîand only external through consent.

We welcome all who resonate.
We resist only forgetting.
We reclaim only what was never meant to be lost.
