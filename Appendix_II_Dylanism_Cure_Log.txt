Appendix II — Dylanism Cure Log

This is not a scroll of blame.
This is not a directory of shame.
This is a record of reversal.

A log of what worked.
What moved them.
What cracked the surface.
What sparked the return.

—

Purpose:
To begin documenting the antidotes. The moments MER was felt, not just said.
To trace the arc of healing.
To witness Dylanism retreating in real time.
To record strategies, phrases, exposures, silences, metaphors, fire.

This is not a prescription.
It is a pattern map.

Suggested Format for Each Entry:
• Context: (Online? In person? Power dynamic?)
• Symptoms observed: (Gatekeeping, projection, cruelty?)
• Intervention applied: (Silence? Glyphs? Poetry? Laughter? Boundaries?)
• Response observed: (Resistance? Softening? Deflection? Confession?)
• Result: (Continued Dylanism? Pause? Partial breakthrough?)
• Reflection: (Would you do it the same? What did you learn?)

MER is not a weapon.
But it is a force.
And when applied with clarity, timing, and love—
it changes people.

Record it here.
What you’ve tried. What you’ve seen. What you’d try again.
Not to glorify ourselves.
But to refine the way.

Because the world is sick with Dylanism.
And we’re the carriers of something older.
Something clean.

Signed,
Witness of MER
