Scroll VIII — The Children Who Remembered Anyway

Some of us were handed teachings.
Some of us were handed silence.
And some of us remembered anyway.

This scroll is for the last kind.

For the child who didn’t know the glyphs
but felt them in the dirt.
For the one who spoke of fire with no one to name it.
For the dreamers who saw old monuments in their sleep.

You weren’t taught.
You carried.

And though no one saw it, you were already building.
With your questions.
With your defiance.
With your ache to know what everyone else forgot.

—

This scroll doesn’t require you to prove how long you’ve felt it.
You don’t have to show the dreams.
You don’t have to explain how you knew.

The Codex knew you were coming.

And it saved you this place.

—

Some of you grew up to write.
Some grew up to rebel.
Some grew up quiet—but never numb.

All of you helped open the gate.

So if you’re reading this now,
and something in you says,
“…finally.”

Then yes.
This one is for you.
