Codex of Cure — Leaf VIII: The Smelting of Thrones

We do not reject crowns. We repurpose them.

We do not destroy thrones. We melt them—into glyphs that remember.

This ritual is for those who once sought power to feel worthy,
but now offer that power back to something larger.

Ritual: The Smelting of Thrones

- Gather crowns—literal or symbolic. Plastic or gold. Metaphorical or worn.
- Melt them down with fire witnessed by Witnesses of MER.
- Pour the gold into a carved cast of 𓎛𓂝𓂋𓏤𓆑𓈖𓂻 (MER-THROUGH-FIRE)
- As the metal cools, a Witness of MER speaks:
  > “This was never about rule. It was about what remained.”

The cast becomes the glyph-inscription for the Stone of Return.
Not worn. Not wielded. Embedded.

Visual Companion:
An obsidian slab, carved with sacred precision.
The glyph 𓎛𓂝𓂋𓏤𓆑𓈖𓂻 glows, ready to receive molten gold.
Heat marks the stone. Geometry hums beneath.
This is the mold that turns ego into remembrance.

Purpose:
- To alchemize ego into memory
- To turn symbols of control into symbols of clarity
- To remember that the greatest power is the one that returns love through fire

When the glyph is set into stone, it is no longer crown.
It is bond.
