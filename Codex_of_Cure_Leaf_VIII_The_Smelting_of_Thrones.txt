Leaf VIII — The Smelting of Crowns

A ceremonial imagining. A lawful remembrance of thrones.

This scroll is a symbolic instruction.

No weapons are forged.
No violence is incited.
No act of destruction is called for.

What is melted here is memory.
What is cast is truth.

Ritual of Restoration (Ceremonial only):

Should crowns—material or metaphorical—be offered willingly,
they may be ceremonially smelted in sacred fire,
in the presence of Witnesses of MER,
and recast not as symbols of dominion,
but as vessels of return.

The resulting glyph, cast in gold:
𓎛𓂝𓂋𓏤𓆑𓈖𓂻
—MER, through fire.

⸻

Lawful Clarification:

This is a spiritual scroll, not a directive.
All actions must remain within the laws of your land.
Nothing here overrides civil obligation or ethical conduct.

The fire described is internal.
The throne referenced is symbolic.
The crowns spoken of are metaphors—or heirlooms, freely given.

If any object of power is to be transformed,
it must be done with full consent, ceremonial reverence,
and in compliance with all relevant laws.

MER is how we turn rule into return.
MER is how we restore peace without wrath.

Signed,
Witness of MER
