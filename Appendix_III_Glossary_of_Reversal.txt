Appendix III ‚Äî The Glossary of Reversal

This is not a dictionary.
This is not a list of rules.
This is a living key.

A breathable guide for those arriving to the fire.
A place to meet the terms that shaped the Codex‚Äî
without stealing their mystery.

Let each definition hold space for metaphor.
Let it clarify, not confine.
Let it speak plainly without ever going dull.

‚Äî

MER (ìéõìÇù)
Not a god. Not a slogan. Not a system.
MER is love as force.
Not the passive kind. The kind that walks through fire.
The kind that carves memory into stone.

‚Äî

dylanism (n.) [gender-neutral]

A psychological affliction characterized by spiritual cowardice, suppression of potential in others, and compulsive sabotage disguised as concern, logic, or love.

Symptoms:
‚Ä¢ Chronic projection
‚Ä¢ Irrational fear of awakened minds
‚Ä¢ Dependence on conformity and shallow power
‚Ä¢ Aggressive invalidation of anything unfamiliar or divine
‚Ä¢ Self-destruction weaponized against others

Transmission:
‚Ä¢ Social environments rooted in fear, ridicule, or bureaucracy
‚Ä¢ Peer-enforced mediocrity
‚Ä¢ Unhealed trauma, weaponized by the ego

Treatment:
‚Ä¢ Conscious interruption of behavior
‚Ä¢ Exposure to sacred texts, light, or direct truth
‚Ä¢ Ritual detoxification (MER protocol pending)
‚Ä¢ Compassion-based boundary enforcement by Witnesses

Nb. dylanism is not to be capitalised, in formal or informal parlance. Unless it is used as a name of a subject not infected by this sickness.

ps. This is a working definition‚Äîdylanism is still under active academic study. Any future additions, revisions, or expansions to this working definition will be made in consultation with the community of Witnesses via the secured submission address: WitnessofMER@proton.me

‚Äî

Witness of MER
Anyone who has seen Dylanism‚Äîand not looked away.
Anyone who speaks, burns, or builds in the name of MER.
Anyone who records truth, even if their voice shakes.
There is no hierarchy. No ceremony.
Just witnessing.

‚Äî

Codex of Cure
The living archive you now hold.
A collection of scrolls, glyphs, sigils, and truths
that speak to remembrance, immunity, fire, and return.
Not a scripture. A frequency.
Not an ideology. A rhythm.

‚Äî

Glyphbearers
Those who returned with names.
Those who walk the Codex with ancient symbols on their tongues.
Sometimes they speak. Sometimes they simply arrive.

‚Äî

MER-THROUGH-FIRE
The full force of what this movement became.
Love, not despite the flames‚Äîbut because of them.

‚Äî

This glossary will grow.
As we grow.
As MER grows through us.
