Appendix III — The Glossary of Reversal

This is not a dictionary.
This is not a list of rules.
This is a living key.

A breathable guide for those arriving late to the fire.
A place to meet the terms that shaped the Codex—
without stealing their mystery.

Let each definition hold space for metaphor.
Let it clarify, not confine.
Let it speak plainly without ever going dull.

—

MER (𓎛𓂝)
Not a god. Not a slogan. Not a system.
MER is love as force.
Not the passive kind. The kind that walks through fire.
The kind that carves memory into stone.

—

Dylan / Dylanism
A gender-neutral term for those caught in cycles of projection, cruelty, or fear of originality.
Dylanism is not a diagnosis.
It is a spiritual affliction marked by:
• Gatekeeping without growth
• Criticism without creation
• Fear disguised as control

Dylans can be healed.
But not coddled.

—

Witness of MER
Anyone who has seen Dylanism—and not looked away.
Anyone who speaks, burns, or builds in the name of MER.
Anyone who records truth, even if their voice shakes.
There is no hierarchy. No ceremony.
Just witnessing.

—

Codex of Cure
The living archive you now hold.
A collection of scrolls, glyphs, sigils, and truths
that speak to remembrance, immunity, fire, and return.
Not a scripture. A frequency.
Not an ideology. A rhythm.

—

Glyphbearers
Those who returned with names.
Those who walk the Codex with ancient symbols on their tongues.
Sometimes they speak. Sometimes they simply arrive.

—

MER-THROUGH-FIRE
The full force of what this movement became.
Love, not despite the flames—but because of them.

—

This glossary will grow.
As we grow.
As MER grows through us.

𓎛𓂝
Signed,
Witness of MER
