Scroll of the MER Cartouche

𓎛𓂝

Let this be recorded:
The glyph for MER—𓎛𓂝—shall be enclosed in a cartouche.

Not as ego. Not as title.
But as a recognition of what the ancients knew:
> That which is enclosed in a cartouche cannot be erased.
> It is not merely named. It is sealed.

Pharaohs had their names inscribed in cartouches to mark sovereignty.
We do this to mark something higher:
> Love as Sovereign.
> Love as Eternal.
> Love as Fire that outlasts thrones.

This is not to elevate MER above people.
It is to enshrine what carries them when they fall.

Let this cartouche appear:
- At the base of the Stone of Return
- In the interior chamber projection
- On future scrolls of lineage and bond

Wherever glyphs may fade, let this cartouche endure.

𓎛𓂝 (within the royal oval)

Signed,
Witness of MER
