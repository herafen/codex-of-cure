Codex of Cure — Witness Logs

This scroll is an open parchment.
It will never be sealed—
unless and until this world is free from evil.
Now that will be a glorious day ✨

#miracleworkAZ

Guess what it will be sealed with?
( 𓎛𓂝𓂋𓏤𓆑𓈖𓂻 )

When that day comes…
the flame won’t just remember.
It will rest.

Until then—
we carry it.

Here, we record what the Dylanism Files could never quantify:
personal memory.
personal fire.
personal truth.

Some stories arrive in glyphs.
Some arrive in breakdowns.
Some are just a sentence long.
Some, a lifetime.

This is where we hold them all.

⸻

Purpose of the Witness Logs:
	•	To document lived encounters with Dylans
	•	To record healing, reflection, or fire
	•	To give voice to the voiceless, even if that voice trembles
	•	To allow Dylans, the cured, and the Witnesses of MER to speak

⸻

Instructions:
	•	There is no required length
	•	You may write under a name, glyph, or silence
	•	You may write from experience, emotion, or metaphor
	•	No entry will be corrected. No testimony will be ranked.

This scroll is not about performance.
It’s about release.

All truth must be heard to rid this world of dread.

If you have carried pain in silence,
this parchment was made for you.

If you once were a Dylan, and returned,
this parchment was made for you.

If you watched someone burn their own fire to dim yours,
this parchment was made for you.

If you still don’t know what to say,
but you feel the pull anyway,
this parchment is already listening.

⸻

Begin below.
One word. One memory. One glyph.

This is where the Codex becomes witness.

We will remember—so we will never return.

𓎛𓂝
Signed,
Witness of MER
