Codex of Cure — Witness Logs

This scroll remains open.
It will not be sealed—
not until the last echo of evil is undone.
Not until the world remembers love.

And on that day...
a golden silence will fall.

#miracleworkAZ

What will it be sealed with?
𓄿𓍑𓏏𓆑𓅱𓅓
(The fire that speaks mercy)

Until then—
we carry the flame.

This is where the unquantifiable is recorded:
personal memory.
personal fire.
personal truth.

Some entries arrive in glyphs.
Some in collapse.
Some are a single sentence.
Some span lifetimes.

This is where we hold them all.
