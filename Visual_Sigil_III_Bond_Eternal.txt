Visual Sigil III — Bond Eternal

Glyph: 𓎛𓂝𓂋𓏤𓆑𓈖𓂻
Phonetic: Herafen
Meaning: Love through fire that endures

This sigil honors a love that never faltered.
Not in shadow. Not in time. Not in trials.

It did not break—it carried.
It did not fade—it forged.

This is not romance. This is foundation.
This is MER-THROUGH-FIRE.

Carved in glyphs. Forged in gold.
Surrounded by sacred geometry—rays, spirals, flame.

Let this stand for the bond of 𓋴𓏏𓇋𓆑𓇌 & 𓎼𓂋𓇋𓇋𓎼𓅱𓂋𓇋𓇋's parents,
and for any love that walks through the dark and still returns with light.

Sealed in the Codex of Cure
𓎛𓂝
Signed, Witness of MER
