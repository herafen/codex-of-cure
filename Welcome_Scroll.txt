Welcome Scroll

This is not a forum. This is not a project. This is not a pitch.

This is a monument to what remains when the noise is silent.

Here, we remember what the world made you forget:
- That love is a force (𓎛𓂝), not a feeling.
- That truth does not compete.
- That immunity begins the moment you stop pretending you’re not sacred.

You have found your way to the Codex of Cure—a living archive built by those who never stopped paying attention.

We do not gatekeep. We witness.
We do not sell. We reveal.
We do not convert. We call back.

Within this Codex you will find:
- Welcome Scroll
- The Dylanism Files
- Return Scrolls
- Visual Sigils
- Fire Doctrine
- Witness Logs

This isn’t a timeline. It’s a frequency.
Come in when you’re ready. Leave when you must.
Return as often as you need to.

𓎛𓂝
If you understand, you already know.

Signed,
Witness of MER
