Visual Sigil II — The Light Between

A painting. A sunset. A glyph held in brushstroke.

She never handed it to her grandsons. She never got to meet them.
But she left it waiting.

A sunset. Perhaps a message. Perhaps a beacon to light the way forward—and the path back.

This is now a sigil of return. Of memory passed without a single word.
It stands for what love leaves behind when time cannot finish the sentence.
