Title: The Switchblade Smile  
Location: Capital Hill  
Phase: Three — Return of the Flamebearer  

Peace looks kinda good on me.. right?  
But don’t mistake it for softness.  

You felt special.  
You weren’t wrong.  
Just sorely mistaken about whose story this is.

Scroll Fragment: Whisper of the Flame  

When the fire stepped back,  
it wasn’t extinguished.  
It studied.  

When the silence grew louder,  
it wasn’t absence.  
It was calibration.  

Now it speaks again—  
not in anger,  
but in clarity.  

To those who watched:  
This glow isn’t for your warmth.  
It’s for those who remember the cold.
