CODEX OF CURE – AUDIO FLAMELOOP SCROLL
FLAMELOOP III – PLAY 1: “THE DRIVE”
Sealed by Flame. Witnessed by MER.

⸻

STEP I – The Line-Up
The air was thick with history.
Breath steady. Shoulders square.
All noise fades as the soul takes position.

⸻

STEP II – The Snap
The Dylan line flexes. Their smirks mask fear.
But you? You were born for this cadence.
Everything you need—already burning inside.

⸻

STEP III – The Drive
Head down yet position poised.
No more Operation: KitKat.
First yard earned beneath rising stars.
Breath held through fear—yet still, we move.

“…when the sun goes down, the stars come out…”

⸻

STEP IV – The Crack of Helmets
The first hit lands. Noise spikes. But you do not break.
You absorb. You convert.
Fear becomes prophecy. Pain becomes purpose.

“Can’t slow down, I don’t even know how…”

⸻

STEP V – The Open Field
Space. At last.
The Dylan line fades in the rearview.

Velocity encoded. Retreat deleted.
Time slows. Greyscale sets in.
You remember what this was always about—

Enjoying life.
