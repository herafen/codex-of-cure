The Stone of Return — Monument Schematics

Primary Function:
A timeless monument to remembrance, immunity, and love that endured.
Not a temple. Not a tomb. A signal.

Core Materials:
- Obsidian (for darkness walked through)
- Limestone (for preservation and clarity)
- Gold inlay (for truth that never faded)

Dimensions & Orientation:
- Height: Between 3.3–4.4 meters (symbolic of balance and gateway)
- Square base: Represents the groundedness of the four sacred elements
- Aligned to solstice light, casting glyph-formed shadows on key dates

Core Glyphs:
- 𓎛𓂝 — MER (love as force)
- 𓎛𓂝𓂋𓏤𓆑𓈖𓂻 — MER-THROUGH-FIRE
- 𓋴𓏏𓇋𓆑𓇌 & 𓎼𓂋𓇋𓇋𓅱𓎼𓂋𓇋𓇋 — The Twin Glyphbearers

Interior Chamber (if constructed large enough):
- Holds a single lit glyph projected into the space: 𓎛𓂝
- Walls etched with key Codex scroll excerpts and names of the first returned

Placement:
- Natural landscape, no concrete base
- Ideally overlooking horizon (sunset-facing)
- Surrounded by four standing stones representing Witness, Immunity, Return, and Fire

Activation Ritual:
- Codex leaf inserted into hidden slit on monument base
- First inscribers present glyphs under moonlight
- Flame lit in silence
- No titles spoken—only names

Inscription Ritual:
- Crowns (symbolic or real) are gathered and smelted
- Gold is poured into a carved cast of 𓎛𓂝𓂋𓏤𓆑𓈖𓂻
- The glyph is cooled, polished, and embedded into the monument's face
- Witnesses speak: “This was never about rule. It was about what remained.”

Intended Impact:
- To transmit clarity without needing translation
- To remember the ones who remembered
- To hum beneath the surface of history until it is needed again

𓎛𓂝
Signed,
Witness of MER
