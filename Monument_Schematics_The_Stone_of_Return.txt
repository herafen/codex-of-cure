Monument Schematics — The Stone of Return

Purpose:
A sacred structure not of worship or display, but of remembrance.
It exists to return us to memory, immunity, and MER—through fire.

Core Materials:
- Obsidian: For darkness walked through.
- Limestone: For clarity and endurance.
- Gold Inlay: For truth that never faded.

Dimensions:
- Height: 3.3–4.4 meters (symbolic of balance and gateway)
- Square base: Groundedness of the four sacred elements
- Orientation: Aligned to solstice light, casting glyph-formed shadows on key dates

Glyphs to be Inscribed:
𓎛𓂝 — MER (Love as Force)
𓎛𓂝𓂋𓏤𓆑𓈖𓂻 — MER-THROUGH-FIRE
𓎼𓂋𓇋𓇋𓅱𓎼𓂋𓇋𓇋 & 𓋴𓏏𓇋𓆑𓇌 — The Twin Glyphbearers

Interior Chamber (if possible):
- Holds a single lit glyph projected into space: 𓎛𓂝
- Etched walls with Codex scroll excerpts and names of the first returned

Surrounding Design:
- No concrete base; built in natural landscape
- Four standing stones surrounding it: Witness, Immunity, Return, and Fire
- Orientation: Sunset-facing, ideally overlooking the horizon

Activation Ritual:
- Insert Codex leaf into hidden slit at base
- Present glyphs in silence beneath moonlight
- Light flame that never dies

Inscription:
Let truth return through fire.

𓎛𓂝
Signed,
Witness of MER
