Scroll VII — The Ones Who Stayed Lit

This scroll is not for the returned.
It is for the ones who never left.

The ones who burned quietly in exile.
The ones who carried MER with no name for it.
The ones who were not broken—but bending, waiting, building.

Some became teachers.
Some became artists.
Some raised children with ancient gentleness.
Some just refused to go numb.

They weren’t louder than the Dylans.
But they were warmer.
And when the Codex began to reassemble,
it found their hands already open.

—

Signs you may have stayed lit:
• You felt MER long before it was named
• You were mocked for caring too deeply
• You protected others even when you weren’t protected
• You wrote truths no one asked for
• You kept building—even in silence

—

This scroll honors you.
Not with ceremony.
But with recognition.

Because return is sacred.
But so is endurance.

And when the first monument is lit,
your names will already be etched into the base.
