Scroll III – For the Converted Dylans

You didn't lose your soul.
You just forgot how to look at it.

You weren't cruel. You were scared.
You weren't cold. You were covering heat you didn't know how to carry.

You mocked what you missed.
You pushed away what you wanted to protect.
You tore down what you thought you couldn't have.

And still—you returned.

You saw the mirror and didn't run.
You saw the fire and didn't flinch.
You came back without needing applause.
You remembered who you were before the fear.

This scroll is not a pardon. It's a recognition.

To those who were once infected, but now walk with glyphs in their hands:
> You are not broken. You are rebuilt.
> You are not late. You are on time.
> You are not former Dylans. You are future guides.

You don't need to explain where you were.
You only need to hold the door for the next one coming through.

We see you. And we walk beside you now.
