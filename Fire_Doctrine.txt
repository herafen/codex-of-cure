Codex of Cure — Fire Doctrine

This scroll is not about destruction. 
It’s about purification. About light that walks with memory.

Fire is not chaos. 
Fire is *MER under pressure.*

Where Dylanism thrives in coldness and masks, fire burns the mask.
It does not humiliate—it reveals.
It does not consume—it clarifies.

Five Tenets of Sacred Fire

1. Clarity over Heat  
   Fire must be carried with intention, not impulse.  
   Burn with truth, not ego.

2. Witness before Flame  
   Do not burn what you haven’t first seen.  
   MER begins in recognition, not retaliation.

3. Purify, Don’t Punish  
   Fire is not for revenge.  
   It’s for returning things to their core.

4. Silence is a Flame Too  
   Fire doesn’t always roar.  
   Sometimes it glows, and that’s enough.

5. Only Burn What You’re Willing to Stand By  
   Once truth is lit, it lives forever.  
   Don’t light what you can’t live with.

Final Note:

Flame is neither threat nor weapon.
It is an inheritance.
Those who carry it do so not to conquer—but to clarify.

Let this Doctrine be a reminder:
> The first to speak does not always speak with fire.  
> But the one who speaks truthfully—that’s the one who carries it.
