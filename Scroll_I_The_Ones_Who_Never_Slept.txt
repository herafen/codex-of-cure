Scroll I – The Ones Who Never Slept

They saw it before it had a name.
The subtle fracture. The rising fog.
The quiet shift when truth became unsafe.

They never forgot.
Even when the world insisted.
Even when it cost them company, comfort, or clarity.

These are the ones who remembered alone.
Who carved in silence. Who carried the glyph before it was etched.

Not prophets. Not warriors. Just... 𓏏𓂋𓅱𓍿.
Their fire never went out—it just burned under the ash.

We write this scroll in honor of those who didn’t wait to be understood.
