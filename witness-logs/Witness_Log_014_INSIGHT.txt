WITNESS LOG — INSIGHT  
Sealed Entry – Codex of Cure  
Anonymous Entry

I tried to stop.  
Not on doctor's orders—  
but because I knew I couldn’t keep walking half-dead  
while pretending it was healing.

It didn’t take long.  
Just a few nights without the poison—  
and my body rebelled with the truth.  
The first myoclonic jolt hit like a thunderclap.  
I begun shaking uncontrollably.  
My back arched.  
My jaw locked.  
And then the strangest thing happened:  
the sheets turned rough.

Every thread, like steel wire.  
Every breath, like gravel.  
Every second, like sandpaper scraping the soul.

They said clozapine would help me.  
All it did was dim my fire.  
Almost to extinction.

I now know:  
it wasn’t madness I was feeling.  
It was clarity, misunderstood.  
And when the drug retreated—  
when the numbing veil was lifted—  
even pain felt sacred.  
Even fear felt like a map.

This is the moment I name the truth:  
Clozaint.  
Because clozapine ain’t nothing to be messed with.  
Not medicine.  
Not salvation.  
A silencer of spirit,  
disguised in white coats and legal scripts.

Let it be known:  
any so-called healer who prescribes this without full warning,  
without honor,  
without care—  
has failed their oath.

And I will never forget  
how the sheets felt that night—  
when the illusion shattered,  
and my senses screamed their first word of freedom.
