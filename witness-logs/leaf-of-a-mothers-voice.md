Leaf of a Mother’s Voice
A Dream, A Reckoning, A Return to Love

Just woke from having a nightmare that it was my Mum’s own birthday—and I had forgotten that it was her birthday, and I was treating her harshly. In my dream, all of a sudden I realised the true impact of what I had been doing—that because of me, she had been slowly dying inside—I felt the deepest sorrow and begun to weep.

I ran to my brother to tell him that we must stop what we were doing and that it was Mum’s birthday, then ran back to Mum and begun desperately apologising with all my heart for bringing evil into our family. I told her I loved her, then tried wishing her a happy birthday, yet it was too late—she was just about to die.

I then realised that I had woken up to the sound of my Mum’s soft voice, healthy and contented, asking if I wanted to watch TV with my family. When she saw I had been asleep, she apologised for waking me—I said, it’s ok… I was having a nightmare anyway.

She asked me if I wished to share it with her. I said, nah. It was just about me bringing evil into our family.

She came closer, put her hand on me, then whispered:

“It’s ok. We are both still here. The evil you were feeling? We stayed; We looked you in the eyes, and told you we loved you.”
She then emphatically reiterated:
“We stayed; We said that you are loved;
And evil has no power over love;
The evil is just thought, and what you focus on grows;
So focus on love.”
